# everwing-zodiac-dragons-simulation
This is a program to simulate how many hatches it takes to get a possible full zodiac bonus (3 dragons of same sign + 1 of any sign)

This assumes an ideal situation where every hatch yields the dragon type that you want (but still random zodiac sign)

You can check simulations.py for the source code of the program.

# Conclusions

On average, it will take around 11 hatches until you get 3 dragons  of the same zodiac sign, this assumes that every hatch yields the same dragon type you want. In reality you will not be getting a legendary Magnis every time you hatch a legendary egg, this means that you will be hatching  **A LOT** before you get a chance to make a perfect Zodiac dragon. Take this into consideration when deciding whether you want to wait to get a perfect match or evolve a non-perfect dragon immediately.

In my opinion, you should get 2 Level 30 dragons asap, even if they are just commons or no Zodiac bonuses just for the extra damage that you'll get immediately. The extra damage will help you with dealing a bit more damage to bosses thus also making it a bit easier to get more money or eggs for hatching. I think the extra utility you get from having more damage immediately is enough to offset the fact that you'll be delaying your perfect dragons for a few hatches. Once you have 2 level 30 dragons then you can start building your perfect level 30 dragons.
